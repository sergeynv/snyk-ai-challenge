      "## Best Practices for Preventing Dependency Confusion\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Use Scoped Packages:** Always use scoped package names for private packages (e.g., `@company/package-name`)\n",
      "2. **Lock Dependencies:** Commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to version control\n",
      "3. **Verify Checksums:** Use `npm ci` which verifies package integrity\n",
      "4. **Private Registries:** Host private packages in private registries with proper authentication\n",
      "5. **Monitor Dependencies:** Regularly audit and update dependencies\n",
      "6. **Least Privilege:** Run npm install with minimal required permissions\n",
      "7. **CI/CD Security:** Implement security checks in build pipelines\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Use Scoped Packages:** Always use scoped package names for private packages (e.g., `@company/package-name`)\n",
      "2. **Lock Dependencies:** Commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to version control\n",
      "3. **Verify Checksums:** Use `npm ci` which verifies package integrity\n",
      "4. **Private Registries:** Host private packages in private registries with proper authentication\n",
      "5. **Monitor Dependencies:** Regularly audit and update dependencies\n",
      "6. **Least Privilege:** Run npm install with minimal required permissions\n",
      "7. **CI/CD Security:** Implement security checks in build pipelines\n",

    "## Best Practices for Preventing Dependency Confusion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Scoped Packages:** Always use scoped package names for private packages (e.g., `@company/package-name`)\n",
    "2. **Lock Dependencies:** Commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to version control\n",
    "3. **Verify Checksums:** Use `npm ci` which verifies package integrity\n",
    "4. **Private Registries:** Host private packages in private registries with proper authentication\n",
    "5. **Monitor Dependencies:** Regularly audit and update dependencies\n",
    "6. **Least Privilege:** Run npm install with minimal required permissions\n",
    "7. **CI/CD Security:** Implement security checks in build pipelines\n",

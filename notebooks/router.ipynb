      "  A critical Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been discovered in the `express-validator` package affecting versions prior to 4.5.0. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code through validation error messages, potentially compromising user sessions and sensitive data.\n",

      "  A critical SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in the `webapp-auth` package affecting versions 2.0.0 through 2.3.0. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands through the authentication query builder, potentially leading to complete database compromise, data exfiltration, and authentication bypass.\n",
      "- **Dependency Confusion in secure-config**\n",
      "  A dependency confusion vulnerability has been discovered in the `secure-config` package affecting versions 3.0.0 through 3.1.9. This vulnerability allows attackers to potentially inject malicious packages into the dependency resolution process by exploiting missing package integrity checks and scoped package naming conflicts.\n",

      "  A critical path traversal vulnerability has been identified in the `data-processor` package affecting versions 1.2.0 through 1.5.1. This vulnerability allows attackers to read, write, or delete files outside the intended directory by manipulating file paths with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, data exfiltration, and potential system compromise.\n",

      "  A critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability has been discovered in the `file-handler` package affecting versions 0.5.0 through 0.8.2. This vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete system compromise, data theft, and lateral movement within the network.\n",

This vulnerability allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users by tricking them into submitting malicious requests. The package fails to implement proper CSRF token validation in API endpoints, making it vulnerable to state-changing request forgery attacks.\n",
